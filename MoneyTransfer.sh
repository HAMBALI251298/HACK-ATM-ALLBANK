## This is a script to simulate connecting to the Swift Banking Network and processing a fake wire transfer.
## Inspired by Hollywood, and designed to be used in conjunction with similar "hacker" simulations on TV.

## Requirements: 
# curl
# dialog

## Here we use Curl to initiate a connection to swift.com for a somewhat legitimate connection.
